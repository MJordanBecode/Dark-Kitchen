# 🍗 Dark-Kitchen 


Dark kitchens are also known as virtual kitchens, cloud kitchens, ghost kitchens or delivery-only restaurants. However you call it, a dark kitchen always revolves around the same concept: selling meals exclusively through delivery. Ghost kitchens have no sitting capacity for in-house diners or walk-ins, as they focus only on delivery, preparing food once an order comes in through a delivery app or an online ordering system.
